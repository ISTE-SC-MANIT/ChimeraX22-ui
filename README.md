This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Step 5: 
If you wish to play in a team, your team leader must search for their comrade, and send them an invitation. 2 people from the same team must have college in the same city. (Note: Your team-mate's name will be visible only after he/she has also logged in/signed up, following the steps above)<br/><br/><br/>

Step 7: 
Accept the invitation of your teammate. Remember that accepting an invitation will make your choice of playing in a team permanent. So accept any received invitations with caution. The member who sends the invitation becomes the Team Leader and the other member who accepts the invitation becomes the Team Helper.<br/><br/><br/>

Step 8: 
Set your team name, whether individual or in a team, you will be referred to by your team name. This step and here on must be done by the team leader only, including the payment. Agree to the terms and conditions of ISTE SC MANIT.<br/><br/><br/>
